A console application to demonstrate Proof of Provenance
for demonstrations purposes.

This console application allows input of creating users and products.
The application allows creating of products by a user and it takes this relationship and broadcast it to our mastercard blockchain.

Every product has a name and a unique hash that is generated by the blockchain by a method stated below.

The application has the following functions:
- Create User
- Create Product
- List Users
- List Products
- Authenticate User with Product
- Transfer a Product between users

All actions are accompanied with logging into the blockchain to illustrate the transparency of the transactions thus sharing the product trail.

There will be file cache that persist the state of the users and products.
When restart the application, all users and products will be restore with the cache.

Firstly we need to capture some values to configure the SDK.
